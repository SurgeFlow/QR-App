#How to launch the application
1. Open a powershell prompt and navigate to the root directory of the repo
    - This can be made easier by navigating to the QR-App folder in a file explorer and then typing "powershell" in the address bar
2. In the powersehll promot execute the following command: `./scripts/launch.ps1`
  - Using a custom launch script, this will start all 3 apps in separate powershell prompts
3. You can view the apps in a web browser here:
  - Primary app:  [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
  - frontend app (in the admin folder): [http://localhost:5174/](http://localhost:5174/)
